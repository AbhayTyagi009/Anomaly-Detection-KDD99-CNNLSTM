# Anomaly-Detection-KDD99-CNNLSTM
This is a project that uses three models developed to classify incming packets on a KDD99 dataset. Three layers are used: KNN, CNN+LSTM, and a Random Forest Classifier. This project is a research based project and the model gives a minor boost in performance over using any of the given models individually.

The final accuracy is 0.97833. The individual accuracy of a single model is:

KNN: 0.976835

CNN+LSTM: 0.9667878

Random Forest: 0.96381378
